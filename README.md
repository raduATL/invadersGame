Invaders Retro Game
This is the Windows Presentatino Foundation (WPF) version of the Invaders retro game project from the book "Head First C#" A Brain Friendly
Guide by Andrew Stellman and Jennifer Greene. Parts of the coding go to the authors of the book. I've done some work adding extra functionality
like a Mothership who increases Player Life, I tried to add Kamikaze, but didn't entirely succedd (working on it). The game was originally 
designed for Windows Store App, which is slightly different than WPF. Added sounds to player and invader shots and ship blasting sounds to both
player and invader. Feel free to ask questions and/or provide input.
